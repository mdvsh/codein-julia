## Task Description

The board of the game can be created using a basic 2-D Array or with GTK.jl.
The game should have a 2 person mode and also a single-player mode where you play against a basic AI.
Play using the console, with a single-player against the computer. Start with a simple, rule-based computer-player. Add some AI capabilities to improve the quality of the computer-player.

The final submission should include a GitHub Gist or GitHub Repo with the code and examples of the game being played in both modes.
