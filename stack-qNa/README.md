## Post a question and answer on Stackoverflow.com with the Julia Tag

### Task Description
**Warning: If you have never used Stack Overflow before, please read their community guidelines on how to ask a good question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). If you do not take the time to write a good question and answer, you will likely get downvoted by the community at large and lose the ability to post questions on the site.**

For this task, you will find read the Julia Docs and then post a question and subsequent answer to that question on Stack Overflow.

You should:

- Write the Question and answer as if you are genuinely posing the question and genuinely answering the question. See an example of this done well [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58997651/how-to-use-operators-as-functions-in-julia/58997652#58997652).
- Make sure the question has not already been asked. If you post a duplicate question the Stack Overflow Moderators will close it and you will no longer be able to post.
- Post both a question AND answer to that question.
Be sure to post something useful that another Julia user may be searching for. I tend to post things that I learned and were contrary to what I thought was correct in case others are also wrong.
- Make sure the question is tagged "julia".

If you have doubts about what a good question and answer looks like, please submit here before you post on Stack Overflow.

Link the question on Stack Overflow once it has been posted.
