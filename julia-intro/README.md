### Task description

This task introduces you to the Julia programming language and its community.

- Make yourself familiar with the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/).

- Join Julia's Slack, check out the different channels (#google-codein channel for Code-In specific discussions and chats) and ask for help there, check out some of the channels that interest your, or just talk to other users. Note: do not need to use your real name on slack, you can use a pseudonym.
- Join Julia's forum, the [JuliaLang Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/). You can ask for help with more elaborate problems and read what problems and solutions other people came across. Go through some of the old posts to get to know some of the frequently asked questions and some of the experts who answer the questions.

Now, let's get started.
